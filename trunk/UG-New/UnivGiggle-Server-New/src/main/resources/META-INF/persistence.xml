        Adding <class>f.q.c.Name</class> elements here is not required as 
        the annotated classes will be detected.
        
        That being said, it will still work if you do add your <class> 
        declarations here for clarity, simply as a way to explicitly see all the 
        classes that are mapped as persistent entities.
