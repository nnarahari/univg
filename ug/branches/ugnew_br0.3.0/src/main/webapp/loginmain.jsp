      <h2>About UnivGiggle</h2>
      <p></a>UnivGiggle is a Collaboration Platform for University Students and Corporations. It helps students meet their day to day,immediate financial needs related to education. An example of such a need can be travel expense for attending a conference or for that matter fees for credit hours in a particular semester.</p>
      <p>It is important that we invest in our socity's future by catering to needs of student community in an efficient way so that they can grow and are prepared to make positive contribution to the society once they graduate.Further,in the current situation of global economic crises, this is an attempt to optimize a portion of corporate advertising to meet twofold requirement.</p>
      <p>UnivGiggle is a virgin idea to meet these requirements in an efficient way.In economic terms, the borrowers would be the current students and the lenders can be fellow students,
        alumini's, and other individual contributors or for that matter the corporate world.In case of the fellow students and other individual contributors it works as a University
        Microfinance System.</p>
      <p>Finally, UnivGiggle rises high and above this to meet the other requirements of the campus by providing Mentor
        Program through which students from any corner of the world would be able to pick a mentor residing in any part of the world who they admire and would to like to learn from 
        them. Ultimately we aim to become the one stop collaboration platform between the students and corporations answering all their needs with no-nonsense applications.</p>
